# INTEL_REALSENSE_circle-detection-
This project was my undergraduate research, where I was tasked to map a research bed for pressure Ulcer Patient. 
For this code to work you must download the intel realsense sdk wrapper from the website. 
The programe is written MATLAB. So, install matlab wrapper. 
I used a HOUGH transform function from matlab to detect the small circle and genrate a bed map at various pressure level.
